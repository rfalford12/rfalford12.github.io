                    <p>I am a senior studying computational chemistry at <a href="cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon</a> and an undergraduate researcher in <a href="graylab.jhu.edu">Jeff Gray's Lab</a> at Johns Hopkins. My research fouces on developing computational tools for modeling membrane proteins in Rosetta: specifically, understanding the thermodynamics and chemistry underlying structure and function. Aside from my research, I am passionate about increasing diversity in computational fields, especially by women and students with disabilities. Toward this goal, I actively mentor high school students, co-led a team of Rosetta students to the Grace Hopper Conference for women in computing, and co-developed a program a program to introduce middle school girls to computational thinking.</p>
                    <p>This spring, I will graduate from Carnegie Mellon this spring and begin my Ph.D. in the fall in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Johns hopkins. I hope that my research will contribute greatly to engineering computational tools to investigate diseases and develop drugs to treat them. </p>
