## Recent Projects

### Improving Rosetta's All-Atom Membrane Energy Function
* Development and scientific testing of a new energy function to improve treatment of the membrane during all-atom modeling
* Model to include support for various lipid compositions (varying chain length and headgroup type)

### Design and Implementation of RosettaMP: A membrane protein modeling framework in Rosetta
* Developed a modular framework for samplign and scoring within the membrane environment in Rosetta3
* Created and tested five proof-of-concepts for visualization, refinement, docking, symmetric docking, prediction of free energy changes upon mutation
* Publication in PLoS Computational Biology (2015)

###  Prediction of deleterious mutants using Rosetta

• Development of an implicit membrane model able to recapitulate physical and chemical properties of lipid bilayers <br> 
• Calibration of solvation and environemnt scores based on recent hydrophobicity scales
