## ThinkTech - A course for middle school girls in computational thinking

Since computer science is sparse in most curricula, there are limited opportunities to acquire necessary computational skills prior to university. Toward filling this gap, we developed a semester-long course focusing on computational skill development, exposure to STEM and confidence building. One of the ten sessions has been pilot tested at Carnegie Mellon's Creative Technology Nights.

## Mentoring High School Science Research Students

Since 2012, I have guided six female high school students through introductory research projects in computational structural biology and bioinformatics. I work collaboratively with the classroom teacher to formulate a question, perform background research and collect data. I also help students learn tools for molecular modeling, visualization, and sequence analysis.
