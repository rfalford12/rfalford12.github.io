## Rosetta Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)

This year, the Rosetta community initiated a new research experience for undergraduates (REU), enabling students to conduct structural biology research in any of the 40+ Rosetta labs and collaborate removely. I assisted with recruiting students at the Grace Hopper Conference, organization of the program, admissions, and was a co-instructor at a week-long workshop introducing students to the Rosetta code.

## ThinkTech - A computational thinking class for middle school girls

As part of a team of three, we created a weekly outreach program for middle school girls (ages 11-14) aimed at computational skill development. Since computer science is sparse in most schools, our goal is to provide students with an avenue to develop necessary STEM skills while also learning about possible careers and applications. One of the sessions in this program has been pilot tested at Carnegie Mellon's Creative Technology Nights.
