## First Rosetta REU Program

This year, I assistend with organization of a new <a href="https://www.rosettacommons.org/about/intern"><b>Rosetta REU Program</b></a>. The Rosetta REU is a pilot for a new REU model model where students conduct research at different sites and use online collaboration tools to stay connected. I assisted with program recruitment at Grace Hopper, admissions, and organizing materials for a week-long course introducing students to development in Rosetta. 

The program was recently highlighted <a "href=http://hub.jhu.edu/2015/07/28/rosetta-software-computational-biology"><b>here</b></a>

## ThinkTech - A computational thinking class for middle school girls

Since computer science is sparse in most curricula, there are limited opportunities to acquire necessary computational skills prior to university. Toward filling this gap, we developed a semester-long course focusing on computational skill development, exposure to STEM and confidence building. One of the ten sessions has been pilot tested at Carnegie Mellon's Creative Technology Nights.

## High School science research mentoring

Since 2011, I have mentored six high school students conduct research projects in computational structural biology and bioinformatics. I work collaboratively with the classroom teacher to formulate a question, perform background research and collect data. I also teach students methods including molecular modeling with **[PyRosetta](http://www.pyrosetta.org/)** and visualization in **[PyMOL](https://www.pymol.org/)**.
