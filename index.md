I am a rising senior studying chemistry and software engineering at Carnegie Mellon. I am also an undergraduate researcher in Jeff Gray's Lab at Johns Hopkins, developing tools for membrane protein structure prediction and design in the Rosetta software suite. I hope to pursue a Ph.D. in Biophysics or Computational Biology and continue develoing new methods for studying the relationship between protein structure, function, and disease.
