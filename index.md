# Welcome

I am a senior studying computational chemistry at **[Carnegie Mellon](http://www.cmu.edu/)**. I am also an undergradaute researcher in **[Jeff Gray's Lab](http://graylab.jhu.edu/)** at **[Johns Hopkins](https://www.jhu.edu/)** focusing on development of computational methods for membrane protein structure prediction and design. My goal is to puruse a Ph.D. in Biophysics or Computational Biology toward developing new methods to study the relationship between protein structure, function, and disease.
