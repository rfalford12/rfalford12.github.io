# Welcome

I am a rising senior studying computational chemistry at **[Carnegie Mellon](http://www.cmu.edu/)**, I am also an undergraduate researcher in **[Jeff Gray's Lab](http://graylab.jhu.edu/)** at **[Johns Hopkins](https://www.jhu.edu/)**, developing tools for computational prediction of membrane protein structure in **[Rosetta3](https://www.rosettacommons.org/)**. I hope to pursue a Ph.D. in Biophysics or Computational Biology and continue develoing new methods for studying the relationship between protein structure, function, and disease.
